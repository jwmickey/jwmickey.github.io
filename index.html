          There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! There's one way and
          only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!
          And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a
          place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Dear God, they'll
          be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

          Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the
          phrase "upside your head." Who's brave enough to fly into something we
          all keep calling a death sphere? Whoa a real live robot; or is that some
          kind of cheesy New Year's costume? For one beautiful night I knew what
          it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Then throw
          her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".
