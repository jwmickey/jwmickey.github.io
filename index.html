                        I live in Raleigh, North Carolina with my wonderful wife Amanda and our dog
                        Charlie and cat Andi.

                        My hobbies include beach volleyball, a healthy amount
                        of good television, and I've recently taken up golf but so far it's
                        an incredible challenge (read: I'm not good).  Occasionally I'll get
                        into the habit of running but I always seem to get out of that habit
                        after an injury or something like that.  I also, oddly, do enjoy
                        the weekly yard-work chores.  It's a great time to zone out and also
                        a great time to problem-solve if there is a nagging work related
                        problem that I'm having trouble with.  Somehow when I'm just pushing
                        the mower around the yard my brain seems to know how to decide
                        when you need to fix the problem and when you need to let it go.  Some
                        weeks I need the grass to grow faster so I can solve more problems!

                        I'm a web developer for <a target="_blank"
                                                   href="http://www.whiteboxlearning.com/">WhiteBox Learning</a>, an
                        educational software company.  I also contract for a joint research
                        project between Virginia Tech and North Carolina State University.
                        Go Pack!  (and Hokies, I suppose).

                        None of the code I write for employers is open source, so my
                        <a href="http://github.com/jwmickey">github</a>
                        profile is a bit thin.  I'm also quite busy with non-programming
                        responsibilities and hobbies, so that doesn't help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully I will find the time to contribute to some of the projects
                        that I use on a daily basis, or at least share some of my hobby work
                        when the free time is available.
